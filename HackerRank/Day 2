Java Loops II


We use the integers , , and  to create the following series:

You are given  queries in the form of , , and . For each query, print the series corresponding to the given , , and  values as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of queries.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective , , and  values for that query.

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Sample Input

2
0 2 10
5 3 5
Sample Output

2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
8 14 26 50 98
Explanation

We have two queries:

We use , , and  to produce some series :

... and so on.

Once we hit , we print the first ten terms as a single line of space-separated integers.

We use , , and  to produce some series :

We then print each element of our series as a single line of space-separated values.


Solution:

import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a,b,n;
        int q;
        q=sc.nextInt();
        for(int i=0;i<q;i++)
        {
            a=sc.nextInt();
            b=sc.nextInt();
            n=sc.nextInt();
            Series(a,b,n);
        }
        sc.close();
    }
    public static void Series(int a,int b,int n)
    {
        int ans=a;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            ans+=Math.pow(2,i)*b;
            System.out.print(ans+" ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
