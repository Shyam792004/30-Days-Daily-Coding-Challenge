JAVA ABSTRSCT CLASS

  A Java abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated. That means you cannot create new instances of an abstract class. It works as a base for subclasses. You should learn about Java Inheritance before attempting this challenge.

Following is an example of abstract class:

abstract class Book{
    String title;
    abstract void setTitle(String s);
    String getTitle(){
        return title;
    }
}
If you try to create an instance of this class like the following line you will get an error:

Book new_novel=new Book(); 


  CODING:
//Write MyBook class here
class MyBook extends Book{
    void setTitle(String s)
    {
        this.title=s;
    }
}
