least prime factor

Given a number N, find the least prime factors for all numbers from 1 to N.  The least prime factor of an integer X is the smallest prime number that divides it.
Note :

1 needs to be printed for 1.
You need to return an array/vector/list of size N+1 and need to use 1-based indexing to store the answer for each number.
Example 1:

Input: N = 6
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2] 
Explanation: least prime factor of 1 = 1,
least prime factor of 2 = 2,
least prime factor of 3 = 3,
least prime factor of 4 = 2,
least prime factor of 5 = 5,
least prime factor of 6 = 2.
So answer is[1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2]. 
Example 2:

Input: N = 4
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 2]
Explanation: least prime factor of 1 = 1,
least prime factor of 2 = 2,
least prime factor of 3 = 3,
least prime factor of 4 = 2.
So answer is[1, 2, 3, 2].
