Minimum element in a sorted and rotated array

A sorted(in ascending order) array A[ ] with distinct elements is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it.

Example 1

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 ,5 ,1 ,2 ,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the minimum element in the array.
Example 2

Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 5, 7}
Output: 5
Explanation: Here 5 is the minimum element.

CODING:
class Solution{
public:
    int findMin(int arr[], int n){
        int s=arr[0];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]<s)
            s=arr[i];
        }
        return s;
    }
};
