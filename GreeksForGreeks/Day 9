Searching in an array where adjacent differ by at most k

A step array is an array of integers where each element has a difference of at most k with its neighbor. Given a key x, we need to find the index value of x if multiple elements exist, and return the first occurrence of the key.

Example 1:

Input : arr[ ] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 6}, K = 1 
        and X = 6
Output : 2
Explanation:
In an array arr 6 is present at index 2.
So, return 2.

Example 2:

Input : arr[ ] = {20 40 50}, K = 20 
        and X = 70
Output :  -1 

OUTPUT:
class Complete{
    
   
    // Function for finding maximum and value pair
    public static int search (int arr[], int n, int x, int k) {
        //Complete the function
        int ans=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(x==arr[i])
            {
                ans=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    
}
